    //try has all the methods that COULD throw an exception, but if it does as soon as it throws
    //exception the remainder of the lines are not executed and it finds catch part and execute
    //kind of like a switch need to have a catch block for every exception so it doesn't bail out
    //whoever calls it is the one that catches it
    //in this case we dont necessarily need the try catch however there may be a time that you need the method
    //you call it to catch the error

    //TODO startPlay should throw an exception
